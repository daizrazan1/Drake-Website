i want to to renevate the entire website and make it look much much better and more appealing. i also want it to be iphone/phone freindly and want it to look very nice and fucntion well on there, also for the fav song gen, i want you to add all the songs from each album that isnt already there into the data and add all his singles listed in his spotify for more precise and accurate answers and also give better options for prefered vibe such as sad,hyped,happy, and party and more, and for the features, take out nicki minaj and rihanna and add young thug ,yeat chris brown, gunna, the weeknd,rick ross. and when giving an answer for the fav song it doesnt HAVE to be a song with that artist , the artist is there to help find the type of music the perosn likes, but there nothing wrong with giving a song with that feature astrist but i just saying it doesnt have to be every time. also in the nav bar make a feature where its a drop down whe u click albums where you can click singles , and it shows all his singles , and also add an option to the nav bar seperate from the albums and sigles, but i want it names "Song creator" wher the usser gets a set of question that the ai helps build the user a drake like song , and also add another page where it called "Song Guesser" where there are 3 drake songs side to side and then when you press play above them for the actual song to guess the user can click a button under each drak essong to choose which is roght and add every drake song ever created to this guesser game all his albuims songss and single songs, and i want it to be timed thing so where they can start the song and pause it , and after they go through a bunch of rounds there is an option where they can see theyre results of average guessing time. and there are photos i provide dof what it should look like kind of . and lastly make sure this wwhole thing looks well and works good on phone and when redesigning the app of the way it looms make sure its very poppy and very smooth
